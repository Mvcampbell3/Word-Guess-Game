Commit 4

Beat the brakes off of the space issue, just decided to not be dumb and make new property in item

also added michael bisping audio file, probably not going to be in final version but for testing

audio clips will now play after the word is correctly spelled. don't know about what happens if new round is press
    before audio ends. testing coming.

Commit 3

Added a modal that gives rules and has start button

Starting to think about the theme I want to use

I am going to have the modal block out everything, page below will have the themeing
    only thing to transfer over will be the h1.mainTitle

The spaces in arrays are evil. For now, I am focusing on single word items

game.used will hold values of pressed keys per word.
    also able to stop chances from going down if same key pressed that is already pushed into used array

added assets folder with css/js/images/sounds dirs and moved things around for proper format

Begining to work on css and html, js works pretty well. DON'T USE SPACES!

Commit1

Added the two files that I have been working on.

Need to find out if I can use the spaces in Arrays for good, not evil.
    
Plan is download the mp3 files and use them from an assets forder through js.

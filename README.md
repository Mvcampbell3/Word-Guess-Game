# Word-Guess-Game

The spaces in arrays are evil. For now, I am focusing on single word items

game.used will hold values of pressed keys per word.
    also able to stop chances from going down if same key pressed that is already pushed into used array

added assets folder with css/js/images/sounds dirs and moved things around for proper format

Begining to work on css and html, js works pretty well. DON'T USE SPACES!

-----------------------------------------------------------
Added the two files that I have been working on.

Need to find out if I can use the spaces in Arrays for good, not evil.
    
Plan is download the mp3 files and use them from an assets forder through js.
